# Wisdom from the Past

## Overview

**Wisdom from the Past** is a landing page application that connects users with AI-powered conversations featuring historical wisdom figures. The platform enables "fireside chats" with personalities like Socrates, Marcus Aurelius, Rumi, and others, positioning AI as a tool for internal growth rather than just productivity.

The application is built as a full-stack TypeScript monorepo with a React frontend and Express backend, designed to showcase three engagement pathways: ChatGPT integrations, low-code workflow tools (n8n/MCP), and API access for developers.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool and development server.

**Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing (lightweight alternative to React Router).

**UI Component System**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS for styling. The design system follows a "new-york" style variant with custom color tokens and spacing primitives defined in the Tailwind configuration.

**State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management with custom query client configuration that includes credential-based API requests.

**Design Philosophy**: The landing page draws inspiration from Product Hunt (voting mechanics), Linear (clean typography), Stripe (technical documentation), and Medium (content-rich storytelling). Typography uses Inter for headings/UI and a serif font (Crimson Pro/Lora) for body text to create warmth.

**Key Sections**:
- Hero with full-screen background imagery
- Voting/leaderboard for wise figures (Product Hunt-style)
- Three pathway options (ChatGPT, Low-Code, API)
- Social sharing with referral links
- Pricing (free tier + API access tier)
- Testimonials from historical figures

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**: Express.js running on Node.js with TypeScript.

**Development Mode**: Vite integration for HMR (Hot Module Replacement) in development, with middleware mode allowing Express to handle API routes while Vite serves the frontend.

**Production Build**: Client and server are bundled separately - Vite bundles the React app into `dist/public`, while esbuild bundles the Express server into `dist/index.js`.

**Storage Interface**: Abstract `IStorage` interface with an in-memory implementation (`MemStorage`) for managing wise figures and votes. The interface supports CRUD operations for wise figures and voting functionality tied to session IDs.

**API Design Pattern**: Routes are registered via a `registerRoutes` function that returns an HTTP server instance. The pattern expects all application routes to be prefixed with `/api`.

**Request Logging**: Custom middleware logs API requests with timing, method, path, status code, and truncated response bodies.

### Data Storage Solutions

**Database Schema** (via Drizzle ORM):
- **wise_figures table**: Stores historical figures with fields for id, name, era, title, bio, sample questions, ChatGPT links, vote counts, and image URLs
- **votes table**: Tracks user votes with figure_id and session_id for vote deduplication
- **conversations table**: Stores user-to-AI chat conversations with id, figureId (numeric 1-51), sessionId, and createdAt
- **messages table**: Stores individual user/AI messages with id, conversationId, role (user/assistant), content, and createdAt
- **aiDialogues table**: Stores AI-to-AI dialogue sessions with id, persona1Id, persona2Id, topic, sessionId, and createdAt
- **dialogueMessages table**: Stores AI-to-AI dialogue messages with id, dialogueId, personaId, content, and createdAt

**ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL with schema validation using Zod. The configuration expects a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and outputs migrations to the `./migrations` directory.

**Current Implementation**: The application uses an in-memory storage adapter during development, but the schema and Drizzle configuration indicate the architecture is prepared for PostgreSQL in production.

**Session Management**: Uses `connect-pg-simple` for PostgreSQL-backed session storage (dependency present but not yet implemented in provided code).

**Chat System (Phase 2 - COMPLETED)**:
- **OpenAI Integration**: GPT-5 via Replit AI Integrations (no external API key required, billed to Replit credits)
- **Persona Database**: Backend maintains personaDatabase mapping figureId to PersonaContext (name, era, title, bio)
- **Dynamic Persona Responses**: Each wise figure generates AI responses in their unique voice and character
- **Conversation Flow**: Users create conversations, send messages, receive persona-specific AI responses with conversation history
- **Frontend Chat UI**: Individual chat pages per persona at /chat/:figureId with real-time messaging, avatars, and loading states
- **Thinking Animation**: Multi-dimensional geometric loading animation (ThinkingAnimation component) with spinning shapes, pulsing center, and rotating wisdom messages while AI generates responses
- **Current Personas**: Simone de Beauvoir (1), Socrates (2), Jesus Christ (3) - verified multi-persona functionality
- **Future Expansion**: 48 additional personas to be added to personaDatabase for complete 51-figure roster

### External Dependencies

**UI Libraries**:
- Radix UI component primitives (accordion, dialog, dropdown, tooltip, etc.)
- Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- Lucide React for icons
- shadcn/ui component system

**Payment Processing**: Stripe integration with `@stripe/stripe-js` and `@stripe/react-stripe-js` for handling API access tier payments.

**Database**:
- PostgreSQL via Neon serverless (`@neondatabase/serverless`)
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries
- Drizzle Kit for schema migrations

**Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod resolvers for validation.

**Development Tools**:
- Replit-specific plugins for dev banner, cartographer, and runtime error overlay
- TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- ESBuild for server bundling

**AI Integration**: 
- **Phase 2 (Complete)**: Internal chat system using OpenAI GPT-5 via Replit AI Integrations
- **Future Integration Pathways**: 
  - ChatGPT custom GPTs (external links)
  - n8n low-code workflow automation
  - MCP (Model Context Protocol) workflows
  - Developer API access for custom integrations

**Asset Management**: Static assets stored in `attached_assets` directory with generated images for each wise figure portrait.
